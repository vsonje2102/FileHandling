# Comment Extraction Programs

This repository contains two C programs for extracting comments from a source file. Both programs read comments from an input file and write them to an output file. The difference between the two programs is in how they handle comments and delimiters.

## Program 1: Basic Comment Extraction

This program extracts comments from a source file but does not handle nested comments. It simply looks for comment delimiters `/*` and `*/`, extracting the text between these delimiters. However, it may not correctly process nested comments and can produce incomplete results in such cases.

### Usage

Compile the program:
```sh
gcc -o extract_comments_basic extract_comments_basic.c
```

Run the program:
```sh
./extract_comments_basic input_file output_file
```

- `input_file`: The source file to read comments from.
- `output_file`: The file to write extracted comments to.

### Limitations

- Does not handle nested comments.
- May produce incorrect output if comments are nested.

## Program 2: Enhanced Comment Extraction with Nested Comment Handling

This program is an improved version that handles nested comments correctly. It extracts comments from the source file while excluding the delimiters `/*` and `*/` from the output file. It ensures that nested comments are properly processed and written to the output file.

### Usage

Compile the program:
```sh
gcc -o extract_comments_advanced extract_comments_advanced.c
```

Run the program:
```sh
./extract_comments_advanced input_file output_file
```

- `input_file`: The source file to read comments from.
- `output_file`: The file to write extracted comments to.

### Features

- Handles nested comments correctly.
- Excludes comment delimiters `/*` and `*/` from the output file.

### Limitations

- Assumes comments are properly closed within the file.

## Common Instructions

### Compilation

You can compile either program using `gcc`:
```sh
gcc -o <executable_name> <source_file>.c
```

Replace `<executable_name>` with `extract_comments_basic` or `extract_comments_advanced` and `<source_file>.c` with the respective source file name.

### Running

Execute the compiled program with the appropriate input and output files:
```sh
./<executable_name> input_file output_file
```

## Notes

- Ensure that your source files are correctly formatted and comments are properly closed.
- The enhanced program is recommended if you need to handle nested comments.

For any issues or questions, please refer to the respective source files or contact the author.
